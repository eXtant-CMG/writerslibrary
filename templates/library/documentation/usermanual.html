    <h2 class="documentation" id="toc_1">Navigating the website: browsing</h2>
    
    <p>This edition can be used either by browsing or by searching through it. The upper horizontal bar serves as a browsing tool that can sort alphabetically among authors, titles and places of publication. The number of items retrieved is shown under each letter to give an idea of how relevant or representative a specific search query is.</p>
    
    <p>It is also possible to sort the book chronologically according to the date of publication. In this case, the browsing bar allows users to view the results grouped by century (the 1700s and 1800s) for old books and by decade for books published in the 1900s. Entries that do not mention a date of publication are listed under 'n.d.'.</p>
    
    <p>If one of these first four fields (Author - Title - Place - Date) is selected in combination with a letter or a specific period, the query will be summarized in a "<strong>breadcrumb trail</strong>" that is located by default between the search bar and the list of results. This trail indicates the various steps taken to reach the current search result.</p>
    
    <p>The last three fields in the browsing bar may be used to reduce the corpus according to the presence of specific attributes in the book volumes: "Inscription", "Reading Traces" and "Marginalia Only".</p>
    
    <p>Clicking the tab "All Reading Traces" will generate a list of books that contain reading traces of any kind, sorted by author's name. The "Marginalia only" tab will further limit the corpus to books with annotations in the margins.</p>
    
    <p>The following information is provided for each book volume:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bibliographical</strong> data: author's surname, name, title, place of publication, publishing house, year (additionally, if different, year of first edition) and editor or translator.</li>
        <li>The <strong>inscription</strong> field signals the presence of a dedication in the author's hand or an inscription of a previous owner.</li>
        <li>If there are <strong>reading traces</strong> in the book, a list of the page numbers on which they occur is given. The page numbers appear in red to help identify books with reading traces more easily.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="documentation" id="toc_2">Book view</h2>
    
    <p>All books in the index for which scans are available can be clicked to enter the "<strong>book view</strong>". In this view the screen is split in two, with facsimiles on the left side and a description on the right.</p>
    
    <p>By default the cover of the book will be the opening facsimile on the left. In the case of multiple scans, users can navigate through the facsimiles using the "<strong>previous</strong>" and "<strong>next</strong>" buttons in the top corners of the images or by clicking the page numbers in the "<strong>Available scans</strong>" drop-down menu.</p>
    
    <p>In the book view, some parts of the bibliographical information above the facsimile can be clicked to produce a list of volumes that share the same author, place or date of publication.</p>
    
    <h2 class="documentation" id="toc_3">Reading traces</h2>
    
    <p>Reading traces may consist of underlined or marked passages, dog-eared pages, and "<strong>marginalia</strong>", i.e. words or drawings in the margins or on separate pieces of paper, written by a previous owner of the book.</p>
    
    <p>If a page contains reading traces, zone numbers appear in the left margin of the image, at the same level as their corresponding trace.
        Clicking on a zone number will activate two pop-up windows on the right side of the screen. The first window is a cropped picture of the reading trace in question, while the second is a text box with a transcription of the reading trace. Clicking the zone image will <strong>magnify</strong> it, clicking again will undo the magnification. To hide the zone popups, click the "close" button in the top-right corner of the text box or anywhere on the left-hand facsimile.</p>
    
    <p>When browsing through a marked book, it is possible to look for keywords among its reading traces by entering terms into the "Search" box at the top of the webpage and setting the filter to "<strong>This book (reading traces)</strong>". When searching through a book's reading traces, you can always type in "<strong>marginalia</strong>" to bring up all the marginal annotations contained in that book.</p>
    
    <h2 class="documentation" id="toc_4">Navigating the website: searching</h2>
    
    <p>The search function of the module extends to the various fields of the bibliographical entry (author, title, place, date) or to the transcriptions of the reading traces.</p>
    
    <p>Once a search has been performed for the occurrences of a specific word in the bibliography, the result page lists the entries that contain the word and highlights the occurrences using yellow background.</p>
    
    <p>The search result for reading traces are listed per zone. Each instance is illustrated by a cropped image of the reading trace within the surrounding context on the page, alongside a text box with the transcription of the reading trace or of the full sentence in which it appears. The transcriptions observe the line breaks of the original text for an easier and faster comparison. The keyword may appear either as part of a marked or underlined passage or in the marginalia.</p>
