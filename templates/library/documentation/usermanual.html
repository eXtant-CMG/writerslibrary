            <div class="pnoindent">The module can be used either by browsing or by searching through it. The
                upper horizontal bar serves as a browsing tool that can sort alphabetically among authors,
                titles and places of publication. The number of items retrieved is shown under each letter
                to give an idea of how relevant or representative a specific search query is.</div>

            <div class="pnoindent">It is also possible to sort the library chronologically according to the
                date of publication. In this case, the browsing bar allows users to view the results grouped
                by century (the 1700s and 1800s) for old books and by decade for books published in the
                1900s. Entries that do not mention a date of publication are listed under 'n.d.'</div>
            <div class="pnoindent">If one of these first four fields (Author - Title - Place - Date) is
                selected in combination with a letter or a specific period, the query will be summarized in
                a "<b>breadcrumb trail</b>" that is located by default between the search bar and the list
                of results. This trail indicates the various steps taken to reach the current search

                    editor or translator.</li>
                    <li>The <b>inscription</b> field signals the presence of Beckett's signature or initials
                        (at times accompanied by the place and date of acquisition), as well as dedications
                        in the author's hand or that of a previous owner. </li>
                    <li>If there are <b>reading traces</b> in the book, a list of the page numbers on which
                        they occur is given. The page numbers appear in red to help identify books with
                        reading traces more easily. </li>
                    <li>The <b>Notes</b> refer to Beckett's copy of the edition and its distinctive
                        features, such as the state of the book, the presence of a bookseller's stamp, pages
                        that have been folded over or a piece of paper inserted between pages. They also
                        provide additional information on the reading traces if these appear not to be in

            <div class="pnoindent">Reading traces may consist of underlined or marked passages, dog-eared
                pages, and "<b>marginalia</b>", i.e. words or drawings in the margins or on separate pieces
                of paper, written by Beckett or by a previous owner of the book.</div>
            <div class="pnoindent">If a page contains reading traces, zone numbers appear in the left margin
                of the image, at the same level as their corresponding trace. </div>
            <div class="pnoindent">Clicking on a zone number will activate two pop-up windows on the right
                side of the screen. The first window is a cropped picture of the reading trace in question,
                while the second is a text box with a transcription of the reading trace. Clicking the zone
                image will <b>magnify</b> it, clicking again will undo the magnification. To hide the zone
                popups, click the 'close' button in the top-right corner of the text box or anywhere on the
                left-hand facsimile.</div>
            
            <div class="pnoindent">If a passage is marked or underlined and that passage is an independent
                sentence spanning no more than two lines, the image will only zoom in on the line or lines
                which make up that sentence. Similarly, the text box will display the full transcription of
                the marked or underlined passage.</div>

            <div class="pnoindent">If a marked or underlined passage consists of three or more lines and

                the beginning and the end of the passage (generally three to four words at each end). This
                way of visualizing the transcription is economical as it saves space and avoids information
                overload. However, the option to visualize a full transcription of longer passages is also
                available by clicking "full extract". Although it may seem redundant to transcribe passages
                which are clearly legible on the facsimile, such a transcription does make it possible to
                perform a search in the reading traces. In every case the writing tool used to mark the
                passage is indicated.</div>

            <div class="pnoindent">If the annotation is written in the margin from top to bottom or vice

                underlined words in the context of the full sentence together with the marginal remark,
                while the text box offers a transcription of the annotation and the underlined passage. In
                order to respect the line breaks of the facsimile, the transcription follows the order in
                which the two elements appear on the page. Exceptionally, if the annotation is made on the
                same level as the underlined passage, the two will be separated by a slash in the text box
